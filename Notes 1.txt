5 ≤ 2𝑥 + 𝑦
Just type 5<=2x+y

Element of (\in): 𝑥𝑥 ∈ 𝐴𝐴                 in
Not an Element of (\notin): 𝑥𝑥 ∉ 𝐴𝐴   not x in y

Subset (\subseteq): 𝐴𝐴 ⊆ 𝐵𝐵
Proper Subset (\subset): 𝐴𝐴 ⊂ 𝐵𝐵   -  subsetof
Super Set (\superseteq): 𝐴𝐴 ⊇ BB    - supersetof

Not Equal (\neq): 𝐴𝐴 ≠ 𝐵𝐵     !=

Set - just a list that kills duplicates
Set Intersection (\cap): 𝐴𝐴 ∩ 𝐵𝐵        intersect
Set Union (\cup): 𝐴𝐴 ∪ 𝐵𝐵               union
Set Difference (A-B): 𝐴𝐴 − 𝐵𝐵           minus

{} in flavor for sets

List
List<X>    - to derive the following - ahould be defaultly available - this means a list that behaves as the basic element (i.e. shared processor)
Number_List
String_List
Boolean_List

String as String_List ...

String:Hello>>substring&Number_startposition=2&Number_endposition=3&Number_size=1
String:Hello>>substring&startposition=2&endposition=3&size=1
"Hello"[2..3] eller "Hello"[2:1] (2..3 is 2 to 3 - 2:1 is 2 and 1 length)

C flavor could be &&, || ! etc.



terminal should be used for examples - a "locked" mode
examples for all the syntax goodies

sets, calculations etc. (based number for a sidebar)

[12 12 12 12] should use a List_Number
["" "" "" ""] should use a List_String
etc.

{} should use a set (special list which screens adds for doubles)

so nice examples like {"foo","bar","baz"} ∪ {"bim"} yields
{"foo","bar","baz","bim"}

console input for Set and List

Set of X and List of X

Set has List input and List output


"," comma should be possible in paramters in uri= Add?Number=2,3
results in multiple calls ie. Number(2) then Number(3)

yes, handy for sets and arrays: Set:Number=1,5,6,9


INHERITANCE: how?

NewResource,NewInput,NewOutput,Clone

ranges

"foo"["o"?] IndexOf?

Console parameters:
&theme=dark,white   // default themes for console (theme switcher?)
&demomode=xx>>yy    // seed terminal with command, remove output closer, disallow input, add run button

PLAN:
update flavor to current features
add features - cloning, list of, set of, list operators, set operators, console support for list and set
update flavor to added features
update not so poignant guide
