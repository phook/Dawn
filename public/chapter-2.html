<h2>1. Starting this tutorial</h2>

<p>Imagine you clicked on the link that brought you to this tutorial (which you obviously already <em>have</em>),
just to find something that looks like a book instead. And adding insult to injury, you already know of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Why_the_lucky_stiff">why the lucky stiff</a>'s 
<a href="https://poignant.guide/">poignant guide to ruby</a>, so this is sacrilege.</p>

<p>So you’re like, “So, this tutorial is just a rip-off!” (Even if you had
never heard of the damn thing before, you start considering if you should just
dismiss this blatant piece of plagiarism.)</p>

<p>Then you ask yourself, “What the fuck?!? I really enjoyed reading why's
book and maybe this guy is not just plagiarizing it, but more like
paying tribute to the masterful original. Maybe he is piggybacking
something great, trying to convey a message?”</p>

<p>No. Please don’t puzzle over it. You don't have to consider the form of the tutorial.
If you haven't already read <em>it</em> then do, and let it work on <em>you</em>. (where <em>it</em> being <a href="https://poignant.guide/">the poignant guide to ruby</a>)</p>

<p>I’ll be straight with you. I want you to open your mind. To forget most of
the stuff you learned about programming. This is <strong>tutorial</strong>, not a book.
It means that the form will show you insights about programming, that are so
insightfull that everyone has lost sight of them. I want you to think about
thinking about the nature of programming, how you can build a set of tools
to let you fix all of your computational problems in a jiffy.

<p>You will probably think I'm a fantast. You will laugh out loud of my ridiculous ideas.
And then hopefully you will think about thinking about programming.</p>

  <h2>What I’m Going to Do When Dawn Becomes The De Facto Language All Over the World</h2>

  <p>Anyone who’s developed a language can tell you how easy it is to be distracted by
visions of grandeur. Over all the years I've been thinking about this I have envisioned 
when all the conferences wanted me as a speaker, that the Nobel prize committee
instated a special prize for me just to honor my services for humanity. 
How job offers would line up along with piles of money praising my gargantuan
intelligence, proven by the God-given language <strong>Dawn</strong>.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, I've also spent a lot of time thinking that I could be
  entirely wrong. That would most certainly explain why no others in the
  whole damn world pursues something in the neighborhood of Dawn.</p>

  <p>So, faced with the 2 options of either being a super genius and 
     the only one in the world seeing the <em>right way</em> or being a 
     complete idiot and the rest of the world being totally right about everything,
	 I of course decided to choose to believe in the most likely. That I am, in fact, a super genius.</p>

  <p>But being a super genius in a vacuum is more like being an arrogant bastard, there 
     will be no ticker tape parades for me, until I manage to convince somebody about
	 exactly what is smart about Dawn. And the fact that I'm not really as fun, inventive
	 and hilariously crazy as why, doesn’t help.</p>

  <p>All this lettuce and vinegar is not really working for me. I'm
     just not <em>that</em> creative.</p>

  <p>I am lousy at drawing cartoon foxes and cats. My best efforts are rabbits and stuffed penguins.</p>

  <p>So let me just hobble along on the back of why.</p>

<h2>2. The LEGO Story</h2>

<p>So let me tell you how I started to think about thinking about programming:</p>

<p>Long time ago I worked at LEGO. You know LEGO - small plastic bricks you step on painfully
   when someone was playing with them last night eating pizza and watching <em>The Breakfast Club</em>.
   At that time, computers and programming was somewhat more exotic than today, so I often heard the
   explanation that programming was just like playing with LEGO. And it just pissed med off. Good ole
   fashion off pissed mood, whenever <em>that</em> happened.</p>

<p>I mean, programming is just <strong>not</strong> like LEGO. Programming is more like sculpturing
using clay. You have to create every little detail yourself, and it takes some degree of mastery
to get something that actually looks like something (No github, npm or stackoverflow in those days).
LEGO is like getting quickly to an approximation of what you want to build. What makes it fun is
that you often change your mind during the build, that you start build the thing that it ends up looking like.</p>

<p>Then one day I started thinking about how a programming language would look like if it actually
were just like LEGO. To have the properties of LEGO. That getting a new box would allow you to just
snap the pieces together with the ones from your old boxes. That you can build parts of a model and
snap the parts together as if they were pieces themselves.</p>

<p>That was the start of a 20 year+ quest. Years and years of looking at new computer languages, thinking
   'Nah, not like that'. Snippets of eureka! moments follow by long months of draught. Well, I was
   doing whatever job I was holding at the time, so it's not like I was idle. But a lot of my ideas
   were pretty radical, in the neighborhood of writing a operating system from scratch, so I still
   hoped that someone out there, saw some of the ideas, picked up the gauntlet and created that
   simple, elegant language that is Dawn.</p>

<p>I waited and waited. The I waited some more. <em>It's too radically different for someone to think it a good idea</em>,
 I thought. <em>I' not even sure it's a good idea. It just exists in my mind, for no one to see.</em></p>

<p>And yet, there I was. One little man at a stupid little desk (and my hair was starting to grey)
 out of billions of people living on a
floating blue rock. How could I make Dawn happen? Maybe just for a userbase of one, just for myself, because that
is how the best things are made - people making good stuff for themselves, that others can appreciate.</p>

<p>The gravestone:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>He thought about Dawn, when Evening arrived.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not at bad epitaph, but meaningless since no one would know what the hell Dawn was.</p>

<h2>3. The Dawn of Dawn</h2>

<p>So, now you’re wondering how I ever got around to implementing Dawn. The quick answer is:
the time was right.</p>

<p>Like when you meet that girl in the yellow dress and you want to kiss her, but you know that
she just got dumped by her boyfriend and if you try to take advantage it will end up in tears, Teddy!</p>

<p>Six months later, somehow, you are holding her hand next to the Ferris wheel and the moment it
reaches the top you finally know the time is right and you kiss her and it's better than cotton candy and
popcorn.</p>

<p>To elaborate a little about how the time was right, there was another quick answer: javascript.
The moment it became possible to use javascript on the server as well as the browser, there was
a platform to piggyback my way to an implementation.</p>

<p>Just as why I should offer you the best reasons to spend a little time with Dawn and
finish the tutorial.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Abstraction.</strong></p>

    <p>Programming is often about getting into nitty gritty itchy bitchy details of programming. 
	Dawn will allow you to do this <em>low level</em> style of programming.
	But mostly you can stay on a higher level using the sensible default behavior.</p>

    <p>Expanding the library. Dawn really allows you to expand the library with new functionality,
	that hooks into the existing framework, so you really <em>want</em> to expand the functionality of the library.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>One man on one peninsula.</strong></p>

    <p>Dawn was born on the Jütland peninsula, Denmark. Denmark <em>is</em> sort of known for its
   programming languages. Why so many Danes takes it upon themselves to create programming languages
   is a mystery.</p>


    <p>And so, here we have Dawn. Created out of the idea that programming should be as easy as building
	with LEGO bricks.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Free and customizable.</strong></p>

    <p>Using Dawn costs nothing. The code to Dawn itself is open for all of the
world to inhale/exhale. Well, it's also not entirely done, so you can actually 
influence it.</p>

    <p>Dawn is e.g. not about strong types in the current iteration, but you can actually
	add them on a later date, if that is your hobby horse. Because of how it is strung together
	it's highly customizable.</p>

    <p>So, it's free and you can freely mold it into something of your liking.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>With that, it’s time for the tutorial to begin. You can bring out your notepad, 
if you don't want to take screenshots or record the entire session. Go on, the
tutorial will be waiting right here for you when you get back.</p>

<h2>4. How Tutorials Start</h2>

<p>Now, if you ever have completed a tutorial, you know that no tutorial is complete without
a lot of talking down to you because you idiot you, know so little of the subject that
you should need to take a tutorial. Well, I won't be the one talking down to you because
I as of writing this, also don't know how everything works.</p>

<p>So even though I may be your guide, this journey is one we take together. This
togetherness, this <strong>synergy</strong>, will hopefully get us to somewhere meaningful.
Someday you may even find yourself buying me a beer in a sidebar somewhere.</p>

<p>So, Hello Yellow Brick Road. We are off to see the wizard. Don't mind the man behind the curtain (it's me).</p>

<p>So that is what this tutorial is. A curtain behind which I can hide. Slanted towards introversion I
kind of like it back here.</p>

<p>Hope I don't get a cold in the draft. See that's why the damn curtain is flapping. <em>It's the wind of change.</em>
Well, the wind of change blows. If you get my drift.</p>

<p>The puns may never end, and well I will not be able to mimic why's style anyway. So forgive me upfront for
the bad puns and stuff. It's just my insecurity talking.</p>

<p>Well, I told you I wasn't going to talk down to you. Well, I won't. I'll get a cartoon rabbit to do it (my foxes are real shitty).
That and a snake eating an elephant are the only drawings I master. And the rabbit a reuse from a kids book I wrote for my daughter.
Would you please not tell her?</p>

<p>And with that let's <strong>begin</strong>.</p>
