<p>So this is the animal that I can draw. No, wait, I remember there were also a 
couple of Moles on Motorcycles in the book. Maybe they'll show up later.</p>

<p><img src="images/rabbit-2.png" alt="Smell of Dawn." title="Smell of Dawn." /></p>

<p>Before we get too comfortable, I have to tell you a weird thing about Dawn. Have you ever
heard of "Code Smell"?. If yes, please forget all you have heard. While Dawn doesn't smell, Dawn will exhibit a scent whilst using it, 
and the fragrance is of your choosing. It is an olfactory explosion, it is not just scent it is flavor. Actually Dawn comes
in different flavors.</p>

<p>So you can change the flavor of all the examples and choose the one you like the best.
A future expansion pack will describe how to create your own flavor. Like Chicken Tikka Masala.
</p>

<h2>1. Language and Well it's not just a language</h2>

<p><img src="../images/the.foxes-3.png" alt="Our friends, those two helpless foxies, finally realize the gravity of their
predicament." title="Our friends, those two helpless foxies,
finally realize the gravity of their predicament." /></p>

<p>My conscience won’t let me call Dawn a <em>computer</em> language. That carries the conventions of many years of <em>how you
are supposed to construct a computer language</em>. If you want you can call the flavors languages, because they follow a somewhat
similar convention.</p>

<p>One convention is that a computer language exits in text files, and you can control each and every character of this so called 
<em>sourcecode</em>. Not so in Dawn. For the sake of flavors, when you edit your source with a particular flavor, this source gets translated
into the Dawn native form, which is the saved version of source. Then the flavor translates it back to you, prettyfying it on the way.</p>

<p>You can say that the flavor is the bridge between the human readable domain and the computer readable domain. Actually they are both quite
readable, so the flavor is more like syntax sugar - but you can control it, should you be a syntax diabetic.</p>

<p>The flavor is the color of you bikeshed. Prefer LISP style backets? Roll a flavor that allows that. Pascal BEGIN END? Ditto.
Python significant whitespace? Consider it done. PASCAL := assignments? Yessir!</p>

<p><strong>Read the following aloud to yourself (with Flavor set to "Basic Pretty").</strong></p>

<!--<iframe class="highlight" src='embed_demo.html?src=codeexamples/Test.dawn&flavors={"Pure":"","*Basic Pretty":"dawn/flavors/basic.bnft","Basic Keyboard":"dawn/flavors/basic.bnft"}' style="width:768px;height:250px;">
</iframe>
<iframe class="highlight" src='embed_demo.html?src=codeexamples/TheQuestion.dawn&flavors={"Pure":"","*Basic Pretty":"dawn/flavors/dawn.bnft","Basic Keyboard":"dawn/flavors/dawn.bnft"}' style="width:768px;height:250px;">
</iframe>-->
<iframe class="highlight" src='embed_demo.html?src=codeexamples/BeckAsText.dawn&flavors={"Pure":"","*Basic Pretty":"dawn/flavors/basic.bnft","Basic Keyboard":"dawn/flavors/basic.bnft"}' style="width:768px;height:250px;">
</iframe>

<p>Just read the above as: <em>Five times “Odelay”.</em>.
Press <em>run</em> in the console below to watch Forest run. Smells pretty good, huh?</p>

<p>Go ahead and try the other flavors - you know you want to.</p>

<p>The Pure flavor is the storage format, the pure form of Dawn. Even though you often use a flavor, you must know about the Pure Dawn.
So set Flavor to Pure while reading the next part.</p>

<p>Dawns most basic building block is the <em>resource</em>. You snap the resources together with ">>". You find the resources using
the URI (Universal Resource Identifier) and use the ">>" to bind them together to form your program.</p>
<p>
One URI rule for them all,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;one URI to find them,<br>
One URI to bring them all<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and in the Dawn scope bind them.<br>
</p>
<p>"Precious", I mutter to myself while writing this. But yes it is - because you know the URI already, right now your browser is using an URI to
find this page - it points to "<scan><img src onerror="this.parentElement.innerHTML=window.location"/></scan>" and the resource in this case is a web page, 
which turns out to be chapter 3 of the <b>Not So Poignant Dawn Tutorial</b>). URI's start with a scheme - browsers usually use the https:// scheme.</p> 

<p>In Dawn everything is a resource that can be fetched by a scheme. An image, a programmatic loop, a number, text, whatever. In the example
notice how the five is fetched using the scheme called "Number" and the text "Odelay" is fetched using the scheme "String".</p>

<p>So if you really want to say this sentence (you really shouldn't), say Number 5 bound to times bound to the String Odelay.
You can use bound, tied, connected to, on top of or whatever relational phrase of your preferral. 
</p>

<p>If you get tired of Beck’s <a href="http://whiskeyclone.net/ghost/songinfo.php?songID=175">mutated Spanish</a> you can.
Crank up your speakers, press run and listen to <em>Three times “Órale!” spoken in Spanish</em>.

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-rb" data-lang="rb"><span class="mi">#> 5</span><span class="p"> >> </span><span class="nf">times</span><span class="p"> >> </span> <span class="s2">"Órale!"<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/></span> </code></pre><figcaption style="text-align:center"><small>Computer Realm</small><button style="float:right">run</button></figcaption></figure>

<p>If you want Beck’s <a href="http://whiskeyclone.net/ghost/songinfo.php?songID=175">mutated Spanish</a>
you can turn your speakers on and try this one on for size (my poor Beck imitation - copyright law, man). </p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-rb" data-lang="rb"><span class="mi">#> 4</span><span class="p"> >> </span><span class="nf">times</span><span class="p"> >> </span> <span class="s2">odelay.wav<br/></span> </code></pre><figcaption style="text-align:center"><small>Computer Realm</small><button style="float:right">run</button></figcaption></figure>

<p><strong>Read the following aloud to yourself.</strong></p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-rb" data-lang="rb"><span class="nb">exit</span> <span class="k">unless</span> <span class="s2">"restaurant"</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">include?</span> <span class="s2">"aura"</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Here we’re doing a basic reality check. Our program will <strong>exit</strong> (the program
will end) <strong>unless</strong> the word <strong>restaurant</strong> contains (or <strong>includes</strong>) the word
<strong>aura</strong>. Again, in English: <em>Exit unless the word restaurant includes the word
aura.</em></p>

<p>Ever seen a programming language use question marks so effectively? Ruby uses
some punctuation, such as exclamations and question marks, to enhance
readability of the code. We’re asking a question in the above code, so why not
make that apparent?</p>

<p><strong>Read the following aloud to yourself.</strong></p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-rb" data-lang="rb"><span class="p">[</span><span class="s1">'toast'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">'cheese'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">'wine'</span><span class="p">].</span><span class="nf">each</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="o">|</span><span class="n">food</span><span class="o">|</span> <span class="nb">print</span> <span class="n">food</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">capitalize</span>  <span class="p">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>While this bit of code is less readable and sentence-like than the previous
examples, I’d still encourage you to read it aloud. While Ruby may sometimes
read like English, it sometimes reads as a shorter English. Fully translated
into English, you might read the above as: <em>With the words ‘toast’, ‘cheese’,
and ‘wine’: take each food and print it capitalized.</em></p>

<p>The computer then courteously responds: <code>Toast</code>, <code>Cheese</code> and <code>Wine</code>.</p>

<p>At this point, you’re probably wondering how these words actually fit together.
Smotchkkiss is wondering what the dots and brackets mean. I’m going to discuss
the various <em>parts of speech</em> next.</p>

<p>All you need to know thus far is that Ruby is basically built from sentences.
They aren’t exactly English sentences. They are short collections of words and
punctuation which encompass a single thought. These sentences can form books.
They can form pages. They can form entire novels, when strung together. Novels
that can be read by humans, but also by computers.</p>

<aside class="sidebar">
  <h2>Concerning Commercial Uses of the (Poignant) Guide</h2>

  <p>This book is released under a Creative Commons license which allows unlimited
commercial use of this text. Basically, this means you can sell all these
bootleg copies of my book and keep the revenues for yourself. I trust my readers
(and the world around them) to rip me off. To put out some crappy Xerox edition
with that time-tested clipart of praying hands on the cover.</p>

  <p>Guys, the lawsuits just ain’t worth the headache. So I’m just going to straight
up endorse authorized piracy, folks. Anybody who wants to read the book should
be able to read it. Anybody who wants to market the book or come up with special
editions, I’m flattered.</p>

  <p>Why would I want the $$$? <span class="caps">IGNORE ALL OTHER SIDEBARS</span>:
I’ve lost the will to be a rich slob. Sounds inhuman, but I like my little
black-and-white television. Also my hanging plastic flower lamp. I don’t want to
be a career writer. Cash isn’t going inspire me. Pointless.</p>

  <p>So, if money means nothing to the lucky stiff, why rip me off when you could
co-opt shady business practices to literally crush my psyche and leave me
wheezing in some sooty iron lung? Oh, and the irony of using my own works
against me! Die, Poignant Boy!</p>

  <p>To give you an idea of what I mean, here are a few underhanded concepts that
could seriously kill my willpower and force me to reconsider things like
existence.</p>

  <p><strong><span class="caps">IDEA ONE</span>: BIG <span class="caps">TOBACCO</span></strong></p>

  <p>Buy a cigarette company. Use my cartoon foxes to fuel an aggressive ad campaign.
Here’s a billboard for starters:</p>

  <p><img src="../images/the.foxes-0a.png" alt="Addiction is like Pokemon!" title="Addiction is like
Pokemon!" /></p>

  <p>Make it obvious that you’re targeting children and the asthmatic. Then, once
you’ve got everyone going, have the <strong>truth</strong> people do an expose on me and my
farm of inky foxes.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p><strong>Sensible Hipster Standing on Curb in Urban Wilderness</strong>: He calls himself
the lucky stiff.</p>

    <p>(Pulls aside curtain to reveal gray corpse on a gurney.)</p>

    <p><strong>Hipster</strong>: Some stiffs ain’t so lucky.</p>

    <p>(Erratic zoom in. Superimposed cartoon foxes for subliminal Willy Wonka mind
trip.)</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Yo. Why you gotta dis Big Smokies like dat, Holmes?</p>

  <p><strong><span class="caps">IDEA TWO</span>: HEY, <span class="caps">FIRING
SQUAD</span></strong></p>

  <p>Like I said, start selling copies of my book, but corrupt the text. These
altered copies would contain numerous blatant (and libelous) references to
government agencies, such as the U.S. Marshals and the Pentagon. You could make
me look like a complete traitor. Like I have all these plans to, you know, kill
certain less desirable members of the U.S. Marshals or the Pentagon.</p>

  <p>Not that there are any less desirable members of the U.S. Marshals or the
Pentagon. Yeah, I didn’t mean it like that.</p>

  <p>Oh, crap.</p>

  <p>Oh, crap. Oh, crap. Oh, crap.</p>

  <p>Turn off the lights. Get down.</p>

  <p><strong><span class="caps">IDEA THREE</span>: BILLBOARDS, <span class="caps">PART
II</span></strong></p>

  <p>How about making fun of asthmatics directly?</p>

  <p><img src="../images/the.foxes-0b.png" alt="Call it a puffer! ROFL!" title="Call it a puffer! ROFL!" /></p>

  <p><strong><span class="caps">IDEA FOUR</span>: ALEC <span class="caps">BALDWIN</span></strong></p>

  <p>Adapt the book into a movie. And since, you know, I’m a character in this book,
you could get someone like Alec Baldwin to play me. Someone who’s at a real
low point in his career.</p>

  <p>You could make it seem like I did tons of drugs. Like I was insane to work with.
Like I kept firing people and locking them in the scooter room and making them
wear outfits made of bread. Yeah, like I could actually be <em>baking</em> people into
the outfits.</p>

  <p>You could have this huge mold that I strap people into. Then, I pour all the
dough on them and actually bake them until the bread has risen and they’ve
almost died. And when the television crews come and I’m on Good Morning America,
they’ll ask, “So, how many people have you employed in the production of your
book?” And I’d respond, “A baker’s dozen!” and erupt into that loud maniacal
laughing that would force audience members to cup their hands over their ears.</p>

  <p>Of course, in the throes of my insanity, I would declare war on the world. The
bread people would put up quite a fight. Until the U.S. Marshals (or the
Pentagon) engineer a giant robotic monkey brain (played by Burt Lancaster) to
come after me.</p>

  <p>Here’s where you’ll make me look completely lame. Not only will I sacrifice all
of the bread people (the Starchtroopers) to save myself, not only will I
surrender to the great monkey brain like a coward, but when I narrowly escape,
I’ll yell at the audience. Screaming insistently that it’s <em>MY</em> movie and no one
should see it any more, I’ll rip the screen in half and the film projector will
spin with its reel flapping in defeat. And that will be the end of the movie.
People will be <em>so</em> pissed.</p>

  <p>Now, I’ve got to thinking. See, and actually, Alec Baldwin did a decent
voiceover in <em>The Royal Tenenbaums</em>. His career might be okay. You might not
want to use him. He might not do it.</p>

  <p>Tell ya what. I’ll play the part. I’ve made a career out of low points.</p>

<h2>2. The Parts of Speech</h2>

<p>Just like the white stripe down a skunk’s back and the winding, white train of a
bride, many of Ruby’s parts of speech have visual cues to help you identify
them. Punctuation and capitalization will help your brain to see bits of code
and feel intense recognition. Your mind will frequently yell <em>Hey, I know that
guy!</em> You’ll also be able to name-drop in conversations with other Rubyists.</p>

<p>Try to focus on the look of each of these parts of speech. The rest of the book
will detail the specifics. I give short descriptions for each part of speech,
but you don’t have to understand the explanation. By the end of this chapter,
you should be able to recognize every part of a Ruby program.</p>

<h3>Variables</h3>

<p>Any plain, lowercase word is a variable in ruby. Variables may consist of
letters, digits and underscores.</p>

<p><code>x</code>, <code>y</code>, <code>banana2</code> or <code>phone_a_quail</code> are examples.</p>

<p>Variables are like nicknames. Remember when everyone used to call you Stinky
Pete? People would say, “Get over here, Stinky Pete!” And everyone miraculously
knew that Stinky Pete was you.</p>

<p>With variables, you give a nickname to something you use frequently. For
instance, let’s say you run an orphanage. It’s a mean orphanage. And whenever
Daddy Warbucks comes to buy more kids, we insist that he pay us <strong>one-hundred
twenty-one dollars and eight cents</strong> for the kid’s teddy bear, which the kid has
become attached to over in the darker moments of living in such nightmarish
custody.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-rb" data-lang="rb"><span class="n">teddy_bear_fee</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mf">121.08</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Later, when you ring him up at the cash register (a really souped-up cash
register which runs Ruby!), you’ll need to add together all his charges into a
<strong>total</strong>.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-rb" data-lang="rb"><span class="n">total</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">orphan_fee</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="n">teddy_bear_fee</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="n">gratuity</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Those variable nicknames sure help. And in the seedy underground of child sales,
any help is appreciated I’m sure.</p>

<p><img src="../images/the.foxes-4a.png" alt="They mock my examples." title="They mock my examples." /></p>

<h3>Numbers</h3>

<p>The most basic type of number is an <em>integer</em>, a <strong>series of digits</strong> which can
start with a <strong>plus or minus sign</strong>.</p>

<p><code>1</code>, <code>23</code>, and <code>-10000</code> are examples.</p>

<p>Commas are not allowed in numbers, but underscores are. So if you feel the need
to mark your thousands so the numbers are more readable, use an underscore.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-rb" data-lang="rb"><span class="n">population</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">12_000_000_000</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Decimal numbers are called <em>floats</em> in Ruby. Floats consist of numbers with <strong>a
decimal place</strong> or <strong>scientific notation</strong>.</p>

<p><code>3.14</code>, <code>-808.08</code> and <code>12.043e-04</code> are examples.</p>

<h3>Strings</h3>

<p>Strings are any sort of characters (letters, digits, punctuation) surrounded by
quotes. Both single and double <strong>quotes</strong> are used to create strings.</p>

<p><code>"sealab"</code>, <code>'2021'</code>, or <code>"These cartoons are hilarious!"</code> are examples.</p>

<p>When you enclose characters in quotes, they are stored together as a single
string.</p>

<p>Think of a reporter who is jotting down the mouth noises of a rambling celebrity.
“I’m a lot wiser,” says Avril Lavigne. “Now I know what the business is
like—what you have to do and how to work it.”</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-rb" data-lang="rb"><span class="n">avril_quote</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">"I'm a lot wiser.  Now I know
what the business is like -- what you have
to do and how to work it."</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>So, just as we stored a number in the <strong>teddy_bear_fee</strong> variable, now we’re
storing a collection of characters (a string) in the <strong>avril_quote</strong> variable.
The reporter sends this quote to the printers, who just happen to use Ruby to
operate their printing press.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-rb" data-lang="rb"><span class="nb">print</span> <span class="n">oprah_quote</span>
<span class="nb">print</span> <span class="n">avril_quote</span>
<span class="nb">print</span> <span class="n">ashlee_simpson_debacle</span></code></pre></figure>

<p><img src="../images/the.foxes-4b.png" alt="They desire to be in my examples." title="They desire to
be in my examples." /></p>

<h3>Symbols</h3>

<p>Symbols are words that look just like variables. Again, they may contain
letters, digits, or underscores. But they <strong>start with a colon</strong>.</p>

<p><code>:a</code>, <code>:b</code>, or <code>:ponce_de_leon</code> are examples.</p>

<p>Symbols are lightweight strings. Usually, symbols are used in situations where
you need a string but you won’t be printing it to the screen.</p>

<p>You could say a symbol is a bit easier on the computer. It’s like an antacid.
The colon indicates the bubbles trickling up from your computer’s stomach as it
digests the symbol. Ah. Sweet, sweet relief.</p>

<p><img src="../images/the.foxes-4c.png" alt="Chunky bacon!!" title="Chunky bacon!!" /></p>

<h3>Constants</h3>

<p>Constants are words like variables, but constants are <strong>capitalized</strong>. If
variables are the nouns of Ruby, then think of constants as the proper nouns.</p>

<p><code>Time</code>, <code>Array</code> or <code>Bunny_Lake_is_Missing</code> are examples.</p>

<p>In English, proper nouns are capitalized. The Empire State Building. You can’t
just move The Empire State Building. You can’t just decide that the Empire State
Building is something else. Proper nouns are like that. They refer to something
very specific and usually don’t change over time.</p>

<p>In the same way, constants can’t be changed after they are set.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-rb" data-lang="rb"><span class="no">EmpireStateBuilding</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">"350 5th Avenue, NYC, NY"</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>If we try to change the constant, Ruby will complain to us. Such things are
frowned upon.</p>

<p><img src="../images/the.foxes-4d.png" alt="Come on, chunky bacon." title="Come on, chunky bacon." /></p>

<h3>Methods</h3>

<p>If variables and constants are the nouns, then methods are the verbs. Methods
are usually attached to the end of variables and constants by a <strong>dot</strong>. You’ve
already seen methods at work.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-rb" data-lang="rb"><span class="n">front_door</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">open</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>In the above, <strong>open</strong> is the method. It is the action, the verb. In some cases,
you’ll see actions chained together.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-rb" data-lang="rb"><span class="n">front_door</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">open</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">close</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>We’ve instructed the computer to open the front door and then immediately close
it.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-rb" data-lang="rb"><span class="n">front_door</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">is_open?</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The above is an action as well. We’re instructing the computer to test the door
to see if it’s open. The method could be called <code>Door.test_to_see_if_its_open</code>,
but the <code>is_open?</code> name is succinct and just as correct. Both exclamation marks
and question marks may be used in method names.</p>

<h3>Method arguments</h3>

<p>A method may require more information in order to perform its action. If we want
the computer to paint the door, we should provide a color as well.</p>

<p>Method arguments are attached to the end of a method. The arguments are usually
surrounded by <strong>parentheses</strong> and separated by <strong>commas</strong>.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-rb" data-lang="rb"><span class="n">front_door</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">paint</span><span class="p">(</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:red</span> <span class="p">)</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The above paints the front door 3 coats of red.</p>

<p>Think of it as an inner tube the method is pulling along, containing its extra
instructions. The parentheses form the wet, round edges of the inner tube. The
commas are the feet of each argument, sticking over the edge. The last argument
has its feet tucked under so they don’t show.</p>

<p>Like a boat pulling many inner tubes, methods with arguments can be chained.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-rb" data-lang="rb"><span class="n">front_door</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">paint</span><span class="p">(</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:red</span> <span class="p">).</span><span class="nf">dry</span><span class="p">(</span> <span class="mi">30</span> <span class="p">).</span><span class="nf">close</span><span class="p">()</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The above paints the front door 3 coats of red, dries for 30 minutes, and closes
the door. Even though the last method has no arguments, you can still put
parentheses if you like. There is no use dragging an empty inner tube, so the
parentheses are normally dropped.</p>

<p>Some methods (such as <code>print</code>) are kernel methods. These methods are used
throughout Ruby. Since they are so common, you won’t use the dot.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-rb" data-lang="rb"><span class="nb">print</span> <span class="s2">"See, no dot."</span></code></pre></figure>

<h3>Class methods</h3>

<p>Like the methods described above (also called <em>instance</em> methods), class methods
are usually attached after variables and constants. Rather than a dot, a
<strong>double colon</strong> is used.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-rb" data-lang="rb"><span class="no">Door</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="n">new</span><span class="p">(</span> <span class="ss">:oak</span> <span class="p">)</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>As seen above, the <code>new</code> class method is most often used to create things. In
the above example, we’re asking Ruby to make a new oak door for us. Of course,
Ruby has to have an understanding of how to make a door—as well as a wealth of
timber, lumberjacks, and those long, wiggly, two-man saws.</p>

<p><img src="../images/the.foxes-4e.png" alt="Plenty of chunky bacon to go around." title="Plenty of
chunky bacon to go around." /></p>

<h3>Global variables</h3>

<p>Variables which begin with a <strong>dollar sign</strong> are global.</p>

<p><code>$x</code>, <code>$1</code>, <code>$chunky</code> and <code>$CHunKY_bACOn</code> are examples.</p>

<p>Most variables are rather temporary in nature. Some parts of your program are
like little houses. You walk in and they have their own variables. In one house,
you may have a <code>dad</code> that represents Archie, a traveling salesman and skeleton
collector. In another house, <code>dad</code> could represent Peter, a lion tamer with a
great love for flannel. Each house has its own meaning for <code>dad</code>.</p>

<p>With global variables, you can be guaranteed that the variable is the same in
every little house. The dollar sign is very appropriate. Every American home
respects the value of the dollar. We’re crazy for the stuff. Try knocking on any
door in America and hand them cash. I can guarantee you won’t get the same
reaction if you knock on a door and offer Peter, a lion tamer with a great love
for flannel.</p>

<p>Global variables can be used anywhere in your program. They never go out of
sight.</p>

<h3>Instance variables</h3>

<p>Variables which begin with an <strong>at</strong> symbol are instance variables.</p>

<p><code>@x</code>, <code>@y</code>, and <code>@only_the_chunkiest_cut_of_bacon_I_have_ever_seen</code> are
examples.</p>

<p>These variables are often used to define the attributes of something. For
example, you might provide Ruby with the width of the <code>front_door</code> by setting
the <code>@width</code> variable inside that <code>front_door</code>. Instance variables are used to
define characteristics of a single object in Ruby.</p>

<p>Think of the <strong>at</strong> symbol as meaning <strong>attribute</strong>.</p>

<h3>Class variables</h3>

<p>Variables which begin with <strong>double at</strong> symbols are class variables.</p>

<p><code>@@x</code>, <code>@@y</code>, and <code>@@i_will_take_your_chunky_bacon_and_raise_you_two</code> are
examples.</p>

<p>Class variables, too, are used to define attributes. But rather than defining an
attribute for a single object in Ruby, class variables give an attribute to many
related objects in Ruby. If instance variables set attributes for a single
<code>front_door</code>, then class variables set attributes for everything that is a
<code>Door</code>.</p>

<p>Think of the <strong>double at</strong> prefix as meaning <strong>attribute all</strong>. Additionally,
you can think of a swarm of <strong>AT-ATs</strong> from <em>Star Wars</em>, which are all commanded
by Ruby. You change a class variable and not just one changes, they all change.</p>

bacon accomplished!" /></p>

<h3>Blocks</h3>

<p>Any code surrounded by <strong>curly braces</strong> is a block.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-rb" data-lang="rb"><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">times</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="nb">print</span> <span class="s2">"Yes, I've used chunky bacon in my examples, but never again!"</span>
<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>With blocks, you can group a set of instructions together so that they can be
passed around your program. The curly braces give the appearance of crab pincers
that have snatched the code and are holding it together. When you see these two
pincers, remember that the code inside has been pressed into a single unit.</p>

<p>It’s like one of those little Hello Kitty boxes they sell at the mall that’s
stuffed with tiny pencils and microscopic paper, all crammed into a glittery
transparent case that can be concealed in your palm for covert stationery
operations. Except that blocks don’t require so much squinting.</p>

<p>The curly braces can also be traded for the words <strong>do</strong> and <strong>end</strong>, which is
nice if your block is longer than one line.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-rb" data-lang="rb"><span class="kp">loop</span> <span class="k">do</span>
  <span class="nb">print</span> <span class="s2">"Much better."</span>
  <span class="nb">print</span> <span class="s2">"Ah.  More space!"</span>
  <span class="nb">print</span> <span class="s2">"My back was killin' me in those crab pincers."</span>
<span class="k">end</span></code></pre></figure>

<h3>Block arguments</h3>

<p>Block arguments are a set of variables surrounded by <strong>pipe</strong> characters and
separated by <strong>commas</strong>.</p>

<p><code>|x|</code>, <code>|x,y|</code>, and <code>|up, down, all_around|</code> are examples.</p>

<p>Block arguments are used at the beginning of a block.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-rb" data-lang="rb"><span class="p">{</span> <span class="o">|</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="n">y</span><span class="o">|</span> <span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="n">y</span> <span class="p">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>In the above example, <code>|x,y|</code> are the arguments. After the arguments, we have a
bit of code. The expression <code>x + y</code> adds the two arguments together.</p>

<p>I like to think of the pipe characters as representing a tunnel. They give the
appearance of a chute that the variables are sliding down. (An <code>x</code> goes down
spread eagle, while the <code>y</code> neatly crosses her legs.) This chute acts as a
passageway between blocks and the world around them.</p>

<p>Variables are passed through this chute (or tunnel) into the block.</p>

<p><img src="../images/the.foxes-4g.png" alt="And then, the dismal truth." title="And then, the dismal
truth." /></p>

<h3>Ranges</h3>

<p>A range is two values surrounded by <strong>parentheses</strong> and separated by <strong>an
ellipsis</strong> (in the form of two or three dots).</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>(1..3)</code> is a range, representing the numbers 1 through 3.</li>
  <li><code>('a'..'z')</code> is a range, representing a lowercase alphabet.</li>
</ul>

<p>Think of it as an accordion which has been squeezed down for carrying. (Sure,
you can build a great sense of self-worth by carrying around an unfolded
accordion, but sometimes a person needs to wallow in self-doubt, carefully
concealing the squeeze-box.) The parentheses are the handles on the sides of a
smaller, handheld accordion. The dots are the chain, keeping the folds tightly
closed.</p>

<p>Normally, only two dots are used. If a third dot is used, the last value in the
range is excluded.</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>(0...5)</code> represents the numbers 0 through 4.</li>
</ul>

<p>When you see that third dot, imagine opening the accordion slightly. Just enough
to let one note from its chamber. The note is that end value. We’ll let the sky
eat it.</p>

<h3>Arrays</h3>

<p>An array is a list surrounded by <strong>square brackets</strong> and separated by
<strong>commas</strong>.</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>[1, 2, 3]</code> is an array of numbers.</li>
  <li><code>['coat', 'mittens', 'snowboard']</code> is an array of strings.</li>
</ul>

<p>Think of it as a caterpillar which has been stapled into your code. The two
square brackets are staples which keep the caterpillar from moving, so you can
keep track of which end is the head and which is the tail. The commas are the
caterpillar’s legs, wiggling between each section of its body.</p>

<p>Once there was a caterpillar who had commas for legs. Which meant he had to
allow a literary pause after each step. The other caterpillars really respected
him for it and he came to have quite a commanding presence. Oh, and talk about a
philanthropist! He was notorious for giving fresh leaves to those
less-fortunate.</p>

<p>Yes, an array is a collection of things, but it also keeps those things in a
specific order.</p>

<h3>Hashes</h3>

<p>A hash is a dictionary surrounded by <strong>curly braces</strong>. Dictionaries match words
with their definitions. Ruby does so with <strong>arrows</strong> made from an equals sign,
followed by a greater-than sign.</p>

<p><code>{'a' =&gt; 'aardvark', 'b' =&gt; 'badger'}</code> is an example.</p>

<p>This time, the curly braces represent little book symbols. See how they look
like little, open books with creases down the middle? They represent opening and
closing our dictionary.</p>

<p>Imagine our dictionary has a definition on each of its pages. The commas
represent the corner of each page, which we turn to see the next definition. And
on each page: a word followed by an arrow pointing to the definition.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-rb" data-lang="rb"><span class="p">{</span> <span class="s1">'name'</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="s1">'Peter'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">'profession'</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="s1">'lion tamer'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">'great love'</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="s1">'flannel'</span> <span class="p">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>I’m not comparing hashes to dictionaries because you can only store definitions
in a hash. In the example above, I stored personal information for Peter, the
lion tamer with a great love for flannel. Hashes are like dictionaries because
they can be very easy to search through.</p>

<p><img src="../images/the.foxes-5.png" alt="The foxes think silence will kill the comic." title="The
foxes think silence will kill the comic." /></p>

<h3>Regular Expressions</h3>

<p>A regular expression (or <em>regexp</em>) is a set of characters surrounded by
<strong>slashes</strong>.</p>

<p><code>/ruby/</code>, <code>/[0-9]+/</code> and <code>/^\d{3}-\d{3}-\d{4}/</code> are examples.</p>

<p>Regular expressions are used to find words or patterns in text. The slashes on
each side of the expression are pins.</p>

<p>Imagine if you had a little word with pins on both side and you held it over a
book. You pass the word over the book and when it gets near a matching word, it
starts blinking. You pin the regular expression onto the book, right over the
match and it glows with the letters of the matching word.</p>

<p>Oh, and when you poke the pins into the book, the paper sneezes, <em>reg-exp!</em></p>

<p>Regular expressions are much faster than passing your hand over pages of a book.
Ruby can use a regular expression to search volumes of books very quickly.</p>

<h3>Operators</h3>

<p>You’ll use the following list of operators to do math in Ruby or to compare
things. Scan over the list, recognize a few. You know, addition <code>+</code> and
subtraction <code>-</code> and so on.</p>

<pre><code>** !  ~  *  /  %  +  -  &amp;
&lt;&lt; &gt;&gt; |  ^  &gt;  &gt;= &lt;  &lt;= &lt;=&gt;
|| != =~ !~ &amp;&amp; += -= == ===
.. ... not and or
</code></pre>

<h3>Keywords</h3>

<p>Ruby has a number of built-in words, imbued with meaning. These words cannot be
used as variables or changed to suit your purposes. Some of these we’ve already
discussed. They are in the safe house, my friend. You touch these and you’ll be
served an official syntax error.</p>

<pre><code>alias   and     BEGIN   begin   break   case    class   def     defined
do      else    elsif   END     end     ensure  false   for     if
in      module  next    nil     not     or      redo    rescue  retry
return  self    super   then    true    undef   unless  until   when
while   yield
</code></pre>

<p>Good enough. These are the illustrious members of the Ruby language. We’ll be
having quite the junket for the next three chapters, gluing these parts together
into sly bits of (poignant) code.</p>

<p>I’d recommend skimming all of the parts of speech once again. Give yourself a
broad view of them. I’ll be testing your metal in the next section.</p>

  <h2>Seven Moments of Zen from My Life</h2>

  <ol>
    <li>8 years old. Just laying in bed, thinking. And I realize. <em>There’s nothing
stopping me from becoming a child dentist.</em></li>
    <li>21. Found a pencil on the beach. Embossed on it: <em>I cherish serenity.</em> Tucked
it away into the inside breast pocket of my suit jacket. Watched the waves come
and recede.</li>
    <li>22. Found a beetle in my bathroom that was just about to fall into a heating
vent. Swiped him up. Tailored him a little backpack out of a leaf and a thread.
In the backpack: a skittle and a <span class="caps">AAA</span> battery. That
should last him. Set him loose out by the front gate.</li>
    <li>Three years of age. Brushed aside the curtain. Sunlight.</li>
    <li>14. Riding my bike out on the pier with my coach who is jogging behind me as
the sun goes down right after I knocked out Piston Honda in the original
Nintendo version of Mike Tyson’s Punch-Out.</li>
    <li>11. Sick. Watching Heathcliff on television. For hours, it was Heathcliff.
And he was able to come right up close to my face. His head spun toward me. His
face pulsed back and forth, up close, then off millions of miles away. Sound was
gone. In fractions of a second, Heathcliff filled the universe, then blipped off
to the end of infinity. I heard my mother’s voice trying to cut through the
cartoon. Heathclose, Heathaway, Heathclose, Heathaway. It was a religious rave
with a cat strobe and muffled bass of mother’s voice. (I ran a fever of 105 that
day.)</li>
    <li>18. Bought myself a gigapet. A duck. Fed it for awhile. Gave it a bath.
Forgot about it for almost a couple months. One day, while cleaning, I found a
chain and he was there on the end. Hey, little duck. Mad freaky, hoppin’ around
with his hair out, squawking diagonal lines. In a tuxedo.</li>

<h2>3. If I Haven’t Treated You Like a Child Enough Already</h2>

<p>I’m proud of you. Anyone will tell you how much I brag about you. How I go on
and on about this great anonymous person out there who scrolls and reads and
scrolls and reads. “These kids,” I tell them. “Man, these kids got heart. I
never…” And I can’t even finish a sentence because I’m absolutely blubbering.</p>

<p>And my heart glows bright red under my filmy, translucent skin and they have to
administer 10cc of JavaScript to get me to come back. (I respond well to toxins
in the blood.) Man, that stuff will kick the peaches right out your gills!</p>

<p>So, yes. You’ve kept up nicely. But now I must begin to be a brutal
schoolmaster. I need to start seeing good marks from you. So far, you’ve done
nothing but move your eyes around a lot. Okay, sure, you did some exceptional
reading aloud earlier. Now we need some comprehension skills here, Smotchkkiss.</p>

<p><strong>Say aloud each of the parts of speech used below.</strong></p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-rb" data-lang="rb"><span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">times</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="nb">print</span> <span class="s2">"Odelay!"</span> <span class="p">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>You might want to even cover this paragraph up while you read, because your eyes
might want to sneak to the answer. We have a <em>number</em> <code>5</code>, followed by a
<em>method</em> <code>.times</code>. Then, the first crab pincers of a <em>block</em>. The kernel
<em>method</em> <code>print</code> has no dot and is followed by a <em>string</em> <code>"Odelay!"</code>. The final
crab pincers close our <em>block</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Say aloud each of the parts of speech used below.</strong></p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-rb" data-lang="rb"><span class="nb">exit</span> <span class="k">unless</span> <span class="s2">"restaurant"</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">include?</span> <span class="s2">"aura"</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Like the <code>print</code> method, <code>exit</code> is a kernel <em>method</em>. If you were paying
attention during the big list of keywords, you’ll know that <code>unless</code> is just
such a <em>keyword</em>. The <em>string</em> <code>"restaurant"</code> is clung to by the <em>method</em>
<code>include?</code>. And finally, the string <code>"aura"</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Say aloud each of the parts of speech used below.</strong></p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-rb" data-lang="rb"><span class="p">[</span><span class="s1">'toast'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">'cheese'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">'wine'</span><span class="p">].</span><span class="nf">each</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="o">|</span><span class="n">food</span><span class="o">|</span> <span class="nb">print</span><span class="p">(</span> <span class="n">food</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">capitalize</span> <span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>This caterpillar partakes of finer delicacies. An <em>array</em> starts this example.
In the array, three <em>strings</em> <code>'toast'</code>, <code>'cheese'</code>, and <code>'wine'</code>. The whole
array is trailed by a <em>method</em> <code>each</code>.</p>

<p>Inside of a <em>block</em>, the <em>block argument</em> <code>food</code>, traveling down its little
waterslide into the block. The <em>method</em> <code>capitalize</code> then capitalizes the first
letter of the block argument, which has become <em>variable</em> <code>food</code>. This
capitalized <em>string</em> is passed to kernel <em>method</em> <code>print</code>.</p>

<p>Look over these examples once again. Be sure you recognize the parts of speech
used. They each have a distinct look, don’t they? Take a deep breath, press
firmly on your temples. Now, let’s dissect a cow’s eye worth of code.</p>

<p><a name="section4"></a></p>

<h2>4. An Example to Help You Grow Up</h2>

<p><img src="../images/the.foxes-7.png" alt="Gettin' cabin fever." title="Gettin' cabin fever." /></p>

<p><strong>Say aloud each of the parts of speech used below.</strong></p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-rb" data-lang="rb"><span class="nb">require</span> <span class="s1">'net/http'</span>
<span class="no">Net</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="no">HTTP</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">start</span><span class="p">(</span> <span class="s1">'www.ruby-lang.org'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">80</span> <span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">do</span> <span class="o">|</span><span class="n">http</span><span class="o">|</span>
  <span class="nb">print</span><span class="p">(</span> <span class="n">http</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">get</span><span class="p">(</span> <span class="s1">'/en/about/license.txt'</span> <span class="p">).</span><span class="nf">body</span> <span class="p">)</span>
<span class="k">end</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The first line is a method call. The <em>method</em> called <code>require</code> is used. A
<em>string</em> is passed to the method containing <code>'net/http'</code>. Think of this first
line of code as a sentence. We have told Ruby to load some helper code, the
<code>Net::HTTP</code> library.</p>

<p>The next three lines all go together. The <em>constant</em> <code>Net::HTTP</code> refers to the
library we loaded above. We are using the <em>method</em> <code>start</code> from the library.
Into the method, we’re sending a <em>string</em> <code>'www.ruby-lang.org'</code> and the <em>number</em>
<code>80</code>.</p>

<p>The word <code>do</code> opens a <em>block</em>. The block has one <em>block variable</em> <code>http</code>. Inside
the block, the <em>method</em> <code>print</code> is called. What is being printed?</p>

<p>From the <em>variable</em> <code>http</code>, the <em>method</em> <code>get</code> is called. Into <code>get</code>, we pass a
<em>string</em> containing the path <code>'/en/about/license.txt'</code>. Now, notice that another
method is chained onto <code>get</code>. The <em>method</em> <code>body</code>. Then, the block closes with
<code>end</code>.</p>

<p>Doing okay? Just out of curiosity, can you guess what this example does?
Hopefully, you’re seeing some patterns in Ruby. If not, just shake your head
vigorously while you’ve got these examples in your mind. The code should break
apart into manageable pieces.</p>

<p>For example, this pattern is used a number of times:</p>

<pre><code>_variable_ . _method_ ( _method arguments_ )
</code></pre>

<p>You see it inside the block:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-rb" data-lang="rb"><span class="n">http</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">get</span><span class="p">(</span> <span class="s1">'/en/about/license.txt'</span> <span class="p">)</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>We’re using Ruby to get a web page. You’ve probably used <span class="caps">HTTP</span> with your web browser. <span class="caps">HTTP</span>
is the Hypertext Transfer Protocol. <span class="caps">HTTP</span> is used to
transfer web pages across the Internet. Conceptualize a bus driver that can
drive across the Internet and bring back web pages for us. On his hat are
stitched the letters <span class="caps">HTTP</span>.</p>

<p>The variable <code>http</code> is that bus driver. The <em>method</em> is a message to the bus
driver. Go <code>get</code> the web page called <code>/en/about/license.txt</code>.</p>

<p>So where you see the chain of methods:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-rb" data-lang="rb"><span class="n">http</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">get</span><span class="p">(</span> <span class="s1">'/en/about/license.txt'</span> <span class="p">).</span><span class="nf">body</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Since we’ll be getting back a web page from the <code>http</code> bus driver, you can read
this in your brain as:</p>

<pre><code>_web page_ .body
</code></pre>

<p>And this bit of code:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-rb" data-lang="rb"><span class="nb">print</span><span class="p">(</span> <span class="n">http</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">get</span><span class="p">(</span> <span class="s1">'/en/about/license.txt'</span> <span class="p">).</span><span class="nf">body</span> <span class="p">)</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>This code gets the web page. We send a <code>body</code> message to the web page, which
gives us all the <span class="caps">HTML</span> in a <em>string</em>. We then <code>print</code>
that string. See how the basic dot-method pattern happens in a chain. The next
chapter will explore all these sorts of patterns in Ruby. It’ll be good fun.</p>

<p>So, what does this code do? It prints the Ruby license page to the screen using
a web-enabled bus driver.</p>

<p><a name="section5"></a></p>

<h2>5. And So, The Quick Trip Came To An Eased, Cushioned Halt</h2>

<p><img src="../images/the.foxes-8.png" alt="Running after the truck." title="Running after the
truck." /></p>

<p>So now we have a problem. I get the feeling that you are enjoying this way too
much. And you haven’t even hit the chapter where I use jump-roping songs to help
you learn how to parse <span class="caps">XML</span>!</p>

<p>If you’re already enjoying this, then things are really going bad. Two chapters
from now you’ll be writing your own Ruby programs. In fact, it’s right about
there that I’ll have you start writing your own role-playing game, your own
file-sharing network (a la BitTorrent), as well as a program that will pull
genuine random numbers from the Internet.</p>

<p style="float:right">
  <img src="../images/graph-1.gif" title="Proof has been extracted from the pudding." alt="Proof has been extracted from the pudding." />
</p>

<p>And you know (you’ve got to know!) that this is going to turn into an obsession.
First, you’ll completely forget to take the dog out. It’ll be standing by the
screen door, darting its head about, as your eyes devour the code, as your
fingers slip messages to the computer.</p>

<p>Thanks to your neglect, things will start to break. Your mounds of printed
sheets of code will cover up your air vents. Your furnace will choke. The trash
will pile-up: take-out boxes you hurriedly ordered in, junk mail you couldn’t
care to dispose of. Your own uncleanliness will pollute the air. Moss will
infest the rafters, the water will clog, animals will let themselves in, trees
will come up through the foundations.</p>

<p>But your computer will be well-cared for. And you, Smotchkkiss, will have
nourished it with your knowledge. In the eons you will have spent with your
machine, you will have become part-CPU. And it will have become part-flesh. Your
arms will flow directly into its ports. Your eyes will accept the video directly
from <span class="caps">DVI</span>-24 pin. Your lungs will sit just above the
processor, cooling it.</p>

<p>And just as the room is ready to force itself shut upon you, just as all the
overgrowth swallows you and your machine, you will finish your script. You and
the machine together will run this latest Ruby script, the product of your
obsession. And the script will fire up chainsaws to trim the trees, hearths to
warm and regulate the house. Builder nanites will rush from your script,
reconstructing your quarters, retiling, renovating, chroming, polishing,
disinfecting. Mighty androids will force your crumbling house into firm, rigid
architecture. Great pillars will rise, statues chiseled. You will have dominion
over this palatial estate and over the encompassing mountains and islands of
your stronghold.</p>

<p>So I guess you’re going to be okay. Whatdya say? Let’s get moving on this script
of yours?</p>
