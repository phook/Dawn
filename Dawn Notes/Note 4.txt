Tiles:
Compose workscreens by tiling apps

Switching between workscreens
Saving workscreens as apps
Launching apps (fullscreen and into workscreen)

Custom apps – no code builds 
Automating tasks (inspiration maya)

apps can offer different screens for the tiling – can be use to configure a single app
