Project source should have login/logout button (if viable) - should be for dawn server/github - localstorage no, 
This would control read/write


UIL Finished:

Templates finished:
dont delete :content, just hide it - to allow insertions the correct place - and a counter for number of children (before the :content tag)
arguments - search for :xx in text node, and int uil-style arguments
create setters to transfer selected to style, and update other arguments

Layers finished:
assign z value to children on add/remove

rename row to rows
rename col to columns
rename uil-style to uil-arguments

canvas element - maybe? like layers but not forcing children to fill - this is for x y placement
for this transfer x and y arguments to top and left, consider allowing z to control z also

---
serverside uil - if uil is pointed to by url, then do server side

DAWN
- finish ide (flavors)
- add color schemes
- build library - files, dirs, localstorage, vars osv.
- connect with uil
- extend BNFT with namespaces and overrides
- reimplement everything that can be replaced with dawn (i.e. minimize "hardcoded" javascript)

- build banana melee
- finish book with banana melee
